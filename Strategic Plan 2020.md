# Strategic Plan AY2020-21

## Executive Summary
Here we will create our strategic plan for the 2020-2021 Academic Year. All of the changes will also be recorded in the Changelog so we can keep a record of our process. 
* Provide a motivation for creating this document.
* Provide some context around the process for creating the document.
* Some context for how to navigate this document (make it clear that it is a living, breathing document).

## Vision & Mission Statements
### Vision Statement

PInT envisions a more **just and equitable world** where all people thrive, and all people have a voice in co-creating their world. We hope to help empower the Olin community to co-create our world and understand their responsibility to serve the public interest. We aim to **redefine engineering** to be centered around humans and the public interest by **embracing values of equity, justice, and inclusion**. Fundamentally, we **value the lived experiences and shared humanity of all people** and believe in a world in which all feel invited and empowered to work on public interest technology. 

### Mission Statement

PInT creates space for all members of the Olin community to engage with and grow their skills in public interest tech, social justice, and activism. We offer opportunities for students to engage in **deliberate reflection** on their personal values and the change that they want to create in the world, to develop the **skills and attitudes** needed to create this change, and to apply this growing mindset to **practical opportunities focused on making their impact** (leveraging Olin’s do-learn philosophy). These activities, and the space and culture we cultivate around them, will help students grow their identity as public interest technologists and **feel both a responsibility and ability to create the change they want to see.**

## Core Values

* Create a **loving, welcoming, and safe space** where all can learn and grow.
* Start **critical, reflective, and ultimately generative conversations** around the social, political, and ethical dimensions of technology.
* **Build community** around the themes of public interest tech .
* Provide **experiential learning opportunities in PIT** through partnerships with local public and private sector organizations that allow community members to make an impact.
* **Open pathways towards careers in public interest tech** to present PIT as a viable and legitimate career path.
* Maximize opportunities for students to develop leadership skills and autonomy, by staying **committed to being student run**.
* Collaborate with all different stakeholders within the Olin community to build infrastructure to **introduce elements of PIT into every aspect of Olin culture and curriculum.**
* Include our stakeholders in **open, well-documented processes of critical participatory action research/co-design**. Be open to change.

## Key Themes & Strategic Principles
* Themes are major functions/goals of the organization.
* within each theme, we will ennumerate priorities for the next semester within these themes. These are not implementation focused, but rather outcome-focused.

### Theme: Student-Led Experiential learning:
PInT will create opportunities for students to practice applying their skills to do work that is **directly aligned with their personal goals and values, with collective values that benefit society as a whole.** In order to create project-based learning experiences, we strive to **develop a sustainable and responsible life-cycle** for pro-bono consulting projects with partner organizations. These projects should support the values of both the students working on the projects and their partners. We also aim to create and share engagement opportunities to **develop career pathways** in public interest technology for students, over the summer and after graduation. These experiences are made more powerful and engaging because they are student-led.

**Priority:** Collaborate with on-campus and off-campus ‘partners’ to create **real and meaningful project-based learning experiences for students to do PIT work**. Students should practice creating, applying, or addressing technology in ways that minimize harm, align with their personal values, and serve the public interest. We later refer to this function as our ‘Consulting Clinic’. 

**Priority:** Create **processes and norms** to provide the **structure and support** for student projects within the Consulting Clinic to succeed. This will include team health exercises, goal setting, reflection activities, mechanisms for providing feedback, and more. These processes should facilitate team progress and communication, and help students grow as public interest technologists.

**Priority:** Develop programming to **help students learn PIT-related skills**. We also hope to connect students seeking specific advice with knowledgeable community members (other students, faculty, staff, alumni) or external resources. PInT aims to foster a culture that promotes asking for help, and makes help easy to find.

**Priority:** Provide opportunities for students to gain PIT work experience as undergraduates and **develop civic and professional identities as public interest technologists.** One way to highlight different PIT-related career paths is by connecting with alumni working in these fields. PInT hopes to expose students to many possible career paths, and empower students to work towards the job that they want, regardless of whether it exists yet.

## Action Plan
* For each theme, we will list out crucial activities/programs to achieve the listed priorities. It should be clear how each activity will help us achieve at least one of the priorities for that theme. Furthermore, we might also include some information about the resources needed to execute each activity/program.
