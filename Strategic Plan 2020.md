# Strategic Plan AY2020-21

## Executive Summary
Here we will create our strategic plan for the 2020-2021 Academic Year. All of the changes will also be recorded in the Changelog so we can keep a record of our process. 
* Provide a motivation for creating this document.
* Provide some context around the process for creating the document.
* Some context for how to navigate this document (make it clear that it is a living, breathing document).

## Vision & Mission Statements
### Vision Statement

PInT envisions a more **just and equitable world where all people can thrive** by empowering the Olin community in our ability to do good in the world. We aim to make “engineering” more humanistic through a **people-centered focus**: both for the people doing engineering work, and for their partners and the people they serve. Fundamentally, we envision a world where, by leveraging and valuing every person’s holistic lived experience, **all people can feel empowered to be public interest technologists.**

### Mission Statement

PInT aims to create a space for the Olin community to engage with and grow their skills in public interest tech, social justice, and activism. This space will include opportunities for **deliberate reflection** on their personal values and the change that they want to create in the world, **development of the skills and attitudes** needed to create this change, and **practical opportunities** to make an impact (leveraging Olin’s do-learn philosophy). These opportunities will help every member of the Olin community grow their identity as public interest technologists, who are both **empowered to and feel a responsibility to create the change that they want to see in the world.**

## Core Values

* Create **loving, welcoming, and safe** space where all can learn and grow
* Start **critical, reflective, and ultimately generative** conversations around the social, political, and ethical dimensions of technology
* **Build community** around the themes of public interest tech through community engagement events, like guest speakers, gatherings, etc
* Provide **experiential learning opportunities** in PIT through partnerships with local public and private sector organizations that allow community members to have local impact
* Develop **pathways towards careers** in public interest tech to present PIT as an equally viable career path, not a weird alternative you have to opt into
* Create opportunities for students to develop **leadership skills and autonomy**
* Collaborate with all different stakeholders within the Olin community to build **infrastructure to introduce elements of PIT into every aspect of Olin culture and curriculum**


## Key Themes & Strategic Principles
* Themes are major functions/goals of the organization.
* within each theme, we will ennumerate priorities for the next semester within these themes. These are not implementation focused, but rather outcome-focused.

## Action Plan
* For each theme, we will list out crucial activities/programs to achieve the listed priorities. It should be clear how each activity will help us achieve at least one of the priorities for that theme. Furthermore, we might also include some information about the resources needed to execute each activity/program.
