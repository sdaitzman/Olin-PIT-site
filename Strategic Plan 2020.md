## Key Themes & Strategic Principles
* Themes are major functions/goals of the organization.
* within each theme, we will ennumerate priorities for the next semester within these themes. These are not implementation focused, but rather outcome-focused.

## Action Plan
* For each theme, we will list out crucial activities/programs to achieve the listed priorities. It should be clear how each activity will help us achieve at least one of the priorities for that theme. Furthermore, we might also include some information about the resources needed to execute each activity/program.
