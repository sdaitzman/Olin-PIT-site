# Strategic Plan AY2020-21

## Executive Summary
Here we will create our strategic plan for the 2020-2021 Academic Year. All of the changes will also be recorded in the Changelog so we can keep a record of our process. 
* Provide a motivation for creating this document.
* Provide some context around the process for creating the document.
* Some context for how to navigate this document (make it clear that it is a living, breathing document).

## Vision & Mission Statements
### Vision Statement

PInT envisions a more **just and equitable world** where all people thrive, and all people have a voice in co-creating their world. We hope to help empower the Olin community to co-create our world and understand their responsibility to serve the public interest. We aim to **redefine engineering** to be centered around humans and the public interest by **embracing values of equity, justice, and inclusion**. Fundamentally, we **value the lived experiences and shared humanity of all people** and believe in a world in which all feel invited and empowered to work on public interest technology. 

### Mission Statement

PInT creates space for all members of the Olin community to engage with and grow their skills in public interest tech, social justice, and activism. We offer opportunities for students to engage in **deliberate reflection** on their personal values and the change that they want to create in the world, to develop the **skills and attitudes** needed to create this change, and to apply this growing mindset to **practical opportunities focused on making their impact** (leveraging Olin’s do-learn philosophy). These activities, and the space and culture we cultivate around them, will help students grow their identity as public interest technologists and **feel both a responsibility and ability to create the change they want to see.**

## Core Values

* Create a **loving, welcoming, and safe space** where all can learn and grow.
* Start **critical, reflective, and ultimately generative conversations** around the social, political, and ethical dimensions of technology.
* **Build community** around the themes of public interest tech .
* Provide **experiential learning opportunities in PIT** through partnerships with local public and private sector organizations that allow community members to make an impact.
* **Open pathways towards careers in public interest tech** to present PIT as a viable and legitimate career path.
* Maximize opportunities for students to develop leadership skills and autonomy, by staying **committed to being student run**.
* Collaborate with all different stakeholders within the Olin community to build infrastructure to **introduce elements of PIT into every aspect of Olin culture and curriculum.**
* Include our stakeholders in **open, well-documented processes of critical participatory action research/co-design**. Be open to change.

## Key Themes & Strategic Principles

PInT will create opportunities for students to practice applying their skills to do work that is directly aligned with their personal goals and values and with collective values that benefit society as a whole. In order to create project-based learning experiences, we strive to develop a sustainable and responsible life-cycle for pro-bono consulting projects with partner organizations. These projects should support the values of both the students working on the projects and their partners. We also aim to create and share engagement opportunities to develop career pathways in public interest technology for students, over the summer and after graduation. These experiences are made more powerful and engaging because they are student-led.

**Goals:**

* Collaborate with on-campus and off-campus stakeholders to create real and meaningful project-based learning experiences for students to do PIT work. Students should practice creating, applying, or addressing technology in ways that minimize harm, align with their personal values, and serve the public interest.

* Create processes and norms to provide the structure and support for student experiential projects to succeed. This will include team health exercises, goal setting, reflection activities, mechanisms for providing feedback, and more. These processes should facilitate team progress and communication, and help students grow as public interest technologists.

* Develop programming to help students learn PIT-related skills. We also hope to connect students seeking specific advice with knowledgeable community members (other students, faculty, staff, alumni) or external resources. PInT aims to foster a culture that promotes asking for help, and makes help easy to find.

* Provide opportunities for students to gain PIT work experience as undergraduates and develop civic and professional identities as public interest technologists. One way to highlight different PIT-related career paths is by connecting with alumni working in these fields. PInT hopes to expose students to many possible career paths, and empower students to work towards the job that they want, regardless of whether it exists yet.

### Theme: Identity Development
PInT will provide opportunities for community members to develop their personal and professional identities. We will provide opportunities for the community to be able to reflect on and construct their own definitions of what being a public interest technologist and/or engineer means. We aim to help community members develop their own internal compass of ethics, and to foster a deep and intrinsic sense of responsibility toward serving people first and designing no harm. Above all, we will empower students to imagine the change they want to make in the world and explore how public interest technology might help them create that change.

**Goals:**
* Through recurring reflection and documentation, identify personal areas of growth and celebrate each others’ development and accomplishments. Learn from this reflection, by revisiting it later.

* Grow an open-minded outlook that helps us learn from the perspectives of others, and learn how to appreciate the multiplicity of values. Learning how to listen deeply and hold contradictions within yourself. Practice having generative and reflective dialogues around these values.

* Help students deconstruct societal definitions of engineering and engineers and understand how societal forces have influenced these constructs, and develop understanding of public interest technology. Through continuous conversation, create space for students to shape individual and collective definitions of public interest technology, engineering, and the relationship between the two.

### Theme: Family & Community
PInT hopes to be a force that connects the Olin community, through shared motivations to serve the public interest. We will actively and intentionally foster a culture of inclusivity and compassion to create a sense of family and safety for everyone in our community. We will build relationships with other groups on campus who are interested in or connected to themes of PIT. Finally, we aim to grow understanding of, interest in, and engagement with PIT across the BOW community to empower all community members to self-identify as public interest technologists.

**Goals:**
* Foster a sense of connection and family to create a safe and inclusive space for all club members. Provide opportunities and activities for club members to listen to and empathize with each other (such as deep listening).

* Develop, document, and share out our team-building activities and processes to help foster a culture of love and inclusivity at Olin.

* Model a norm of transparency by actively and frequently soliciting feedback from the team and community at large, to co-create PInT with our stakeholders.

* Connect and collaborate with other student organizations who have a shared interest in learning about and engaging with PIT.

* Continue hosting community wide events for everyone to gather around PIT. Provide opportunities for networking and relationship-building between all constituencies of the community: current students, faculty, staff, and alumni. When ready, grow our definition of community, to incorporate Babson, Wellesley, alumni, and our local surroundings.

### Theme: Sustainability & Institutionalization of PInT
We envision PInT becoming an integral part of the Olin culture and curriculum, and aim to achieve this goal by intentionally building relationships with key constituencies and building sustainable practices for our leadership team. We will connect with faculty, staff and administration to work together to institutionalize and legitimize PInT. We will also design robust, healthy, and resilient processes for our leadership team, to ensure we can be good stewards of PInT. Finally, we will connect with other external stakeholders, like the BOW community or the PIT-UN, to help grow PInT (and the college).

**Goals:**
* provide clear pathways for PInT members to take leadership opportunities, and create safe ways for them to join in the co-creation of PInT.

* Collaborate with faculty to both support and drive ongoing efforts and create new efforts to integrate PIT into the curriculum. Work with faculty stakeholders to co-design the future of PInT and shape how PIT will fit into Olin’s future. 

* Define leadership structure and transition methods. Successfully transition to a new leadership team by the end of the academic year.

* Foster healthy practices within the leadership team. Take care of ourselves and each other as a team by holding team health check-ins and setting clear commitments to each other.

* Document our processes and learnings thoroughly and intentionally in an organized public-facing format so that other groups (at and beyond Olin) can learn about our work.

* Connect with other institutional structures such as Babson, Wellesley or members of the PIT-UN. 


## Action Plan

We first identified an MVP for PInT, which is as follows:
* Culture-setting: Intentionally set a tone of inclusivity, safety, and open-mindedness at the beginning of each semester, and maintain this throughout that time.  + team bonding

* Team on-boarding process for members joining the team

* Real world connections (any combination of: reading articles together, having group discussions, book club, newsletter, PITeas, ...) dialogues on what PIT is, and what it means to engage with it

* Facilitate connections to projects (could be anything from a google doc of Olin + non-olin opportunities, to organizing funding and support for individual projects, to coordinating and running a PInT consulting clinic, to running a fellowship/supporting student work in PIT fields)

* Secure funding for PInT (could be big grant or fundraiser or even just club funding if it comes to that)

* Leadership will have check-ins with faculty advisors to share updates, ideas, and pass on material/documentation created

* Physical space on-campus to store PInT related things + physical (or digital) space for PInT members to meet

* Leadership team transitions - to whatever level being on the leadership means

We then considered all possible actions for the next AY and wrote a small proposal for each one. Those actions are in this document: (Actions Outline)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4t1vhRQSTktZN5s19_3NUa_o6XUF6_3bz_9BfFUg7M/edit?usp=sharing]. Keep in mind that all actions besides those aligned with PInT MVP are tentative as of this time.
