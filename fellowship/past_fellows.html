            <h1>2020 FELLOWS</h1>
            <p>2020 was our inaugural year of the PInT summer fellowship and we had three incredible fellows.</p>
            <h2>AUSTIN VESELIZA '22</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the summer, Austin Veseliza was looking for ways to “get involved in coronavirus relief efforts at a level I would not have been able to without this.” He partnered with Ayudando Latinos A Soñar (ALAS), a Latino Cultural Arts and Social Services Program in Half Moon Bay, California. Austin used his technical understanding of systems architecture and the active listening he practiced in Engineering for Humanity to serve ALAS. Over summer 2020, he used his PInT fellowship to build out a flexible, resilient IT infrastructure that will allow them to support their operations throughout and after the pandemic.</p>
            <h2>MAIA MATERMAN '22</h2>
            <p>When she started, Maia Materman was “really excited to do work that I feel is meaningful and important and dive deep into an area that I haven't had the opportunity to explore as much as I'd like to.” At the Coalition on Homelessness in California, she worked directly on local policy and legislation to support people experiencing homelessness. In her work, she collaborated with other organizations working to create alternatives to police response to homelessness and advocated for the health and safety of people who are homeless during the pandemic. She chose to direct her fellowship toward a policy-based approach to public interest work.</p>
            <h2>JOCELYN JIMENEZ '22</h2>
            <p>As she was considering partner organizations, Jocelyn Jimenez was “most excited about broadening my horizons and working with a very welcoming and passionate organization that focuses on uplifting people from diverse backgrounds.” She partnered with Education is Freedom, a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive, local, direct support to students who face socioeconomic barriers to their education. The organization’s network of advisors has helped over 100,000 students complete the college process. Jocelyn created structured, virtual resources for their students, redesigned their website to meet their current needs, and used the human-centered design approach she studied in UOCD to create events to serve students as effectively as possible while keeping them safely distanced.</p>
