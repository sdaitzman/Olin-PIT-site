            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>The PInT Summer 2020 Fellowship is a fully-funded program that will allow up to three of <a
                    href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin College’s</a> engineering students to work at public interest
                organizations and advance Olin’s <a
                    href="http://www.olin.edu/about/at-a-glance/vision-mission/">mission</a> to <em>recognize needs,
                    design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world</em>. We provide a
                stipend and a budget for travel, housing and supplies.</p>
            <p><a href="/">PInT</a> (as in “Public Interest Technology”) is a student-led effort to cultivate pathways
                and opportunities for Olin's students, faculty, and staff to be creators, engineers, designers, artists,
                and activists who leverage and deepen their powerful technical and creative skills for justice, equity,
                inclusion, and doing good in the world. As part of PInT’s greater effort to create strong career
                pathways for engineering students to make the world better, we hope this fellowship will expand
                awareness of public interest careers for engineers. PInT Fellows can choose to seek or create summer
                internships at public interest organizations such as government offices, public institutions,
                non-profits, community-based organizations, advocacy campaigns, foundations, environmental
                organizations, and more. We want you to find an organization that is doing things you are passionate
                about, where you can potentially affect positive change.</p>
            <p>PInT is a founding chapter of the <a
                    href="https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/university-network/">Public Interest
                    Technology University Network (PIT-UN)</a>, a major initiative of the <a
                    href="https://www.newamerica.org/">New America Foundation</a>. We recently received a grant from the
                New America Foundation to support our team (PInT), and to create this fellowship.</p>

            <h1>FELLOWSHIP STRUCTURE</h1>
            <p>We are offering up to three fellowships during the summer of 2020, each providing a stipend of $6000, a
                $3000 housing allowance, $1000 for travel, and $500 for project material costs. To be eligible, you must
                be a student at Olin College of Engineering in your first, second or third year.</p>

            <h1>TIMELINE</h1>
            <p>We will use a rolling selection system, which means that you can apply as soon as you like. We will begin
                reading applications in January, so it is in your best interest to apply as soon as possible.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Now - Spring:</strong> rolling application window.</li>
                <li><strong>December - January:</strong> information sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>January - Spring:</strong> application reading and followup interviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Beginning February:</strong> offers made to fellows.</li>
                <li><strong>April - May:</strong> fellows work with PInT to finalize and select public interest
                    organizational partnerships.</li>
                <li><strong>May:</strong> pre-summer orientation program for fellows.</li>
                <li><strong>June - August:</strong> fellowship internships underway.</li>
                <li><strong>Fall 2020:</strong> fellows report back to the larger Olin community on their summers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>WHAT’S IN IT FOR STUDENTS?</h1>
            <p>Summer breaks between semesters are the perfect opportunity for exploration, in addition to the
                traditional skill-building experience. This fellowship is a chance to swerve outside of obvious paths
                and have deep immersion into disciplinary expertise and professional practices in the emerging field of
                Public Interest Technology. You may operate in your host organization as someone with deep technical
                engineering know-how that benefits the group, if it’s desired, although that is not required to be part
                of the work you do.</p>
            <p>Through this fellowship, students already considering a future path in public interest technology have a
                chance to explore and navigate what that means. Students uncertain about their future path have an
                opportunity to explore what life and work are like for people working to serve the public interest. What
                are their goals and challenges? How did they construct their pathways? Where and when does engineering
                play a role in amplifying this work? You’ll be able to discover new professional routes for engineers
                and new uses for your engineering skills that you’d never imagined.</p>

            <h1>WHAT’S IN IT FOR PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS?</h1>
            <p>Are you interested in adding a summer intern from engineering fields to your team? We’re offering a
                fully-funded stipend for three students from Olin College of Engineering to be placed in public interest
                organizations such as government offices, public institutions, non-profits, community-based
                organizations, advocacy campaigns, foundations, environmental organizations, and more. These PInT
                Fellows can support your work in various roles: for technical work, non-technical work, or both,
                depending on the mutual interests and affinities between the individual and host. All Olin students do
                hands-on, team-based work in multiple engineering domains from their first days at Olin, and are
                selected for our community by demonstrating a collaborative, open-minded disposition in addition to
                their STEM training. We’re looking for organizations where any technical functions aren’t isolated in a
                silo. Instead, we want students to contextualize their work. Fellows will experience the broad
                connections between technology and society, and between different disciplines and organizational
                functions, from administration to direct service, activism, and all that is in between. Our fellows will
                be engineers-in-training who are explicitly passionate about connecting their work to your goals. If you
                have questions or would like to express interest, please reach out to us at <a
                    href="mailto:pintfellowship@olin.edu">pintfellowship@olin.edu</a>.</p>

            <h1>INTERNSHIP REQUIREMENTS</h1>
            <ul>

            <h1>HOW TO APPLY</h1>
            <p>Finding an initial group of public interest organizations you would be interested in working at is an
                important part of your <a href="http://bit.ly/pintfellowshipapp">application</a>. The application form
                also includes the following questions for response, in addition to background information and a brief
                cover letter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Think back to when you wrote your Olin essay on change. Reflect on how your response today would
                    compare to your response when you applied.</li>
                <span class="subnote">Please limit your response to 300 words. The most recent iteration of the Olin
                    application question reads: "Olin is a community striving to improve the world and improve people’s
                    lives through engineering education. What change do you hope to be a part of? Why is this particular
                    change important to you? How do you want to improve the world?" If you do not remember what you
                    wrote in response to this, think about how your pre-Olin self would have thought about this, and
                    compare it to how your current self feels.</span>
                <li>What impact do you want to have through this fellowship?</li>
                <span class="subnote">Please limit your response to 150 words.</span>
                <li>What impact do you hope this fellowship will have on you?</li>
                <span class="subnote">Please limit your response to 150 words.</span>
                <li>At the end of this experience, what do you see yourself bringing back to the Olin community?</li>
                <span class="subnote">Please limit your response to 300 words.</span>

            <h1>ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION</h1>
            <p>We explicitly invite underrepresented and marginalized groups to apply, and we are eager to work to
                mitigate barriers to participation by providing accommodations or assistance. All applicants are
                expected to abide by PInT’s <a href="https://github.com/olin/clubs/blob/master/charters/PInT.md">club
                    charter</a>, including our Diversity and Inclusion statement and Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p>We seek to exceed legal requirements for accessibility and nondiscrimination. Your background should not
                affect your ability to apply for this fellowship, or succeed if accepted. Please reach out to <a
                    href="mailto:pintfellowship@olin.edu">pintfellowship@olin.edu</a> with any questions, feedback or
                requests.</p>

            <h1>WHY IS PInT DOING THIS?</h1>
            <p>Students can start to gain Public Interest Technology (PIT) work experience and insight into PIT careers
                through our pro-bono consulting projects and events. Summer fellowships support students to do work with
                organizations that would not normally hire engineering interns. Paying students to do extended projects
                that serve the public interest explicitly opens access to PIT careers to our students, especially if
                they cannot afford unpaid options.</p>
            <p>The fellowships will help students imagine themselves creating a PIT career and to credibly engage other
                students at Olin upon their return in seeing the wider universe of applications for their skills.
                Additionally, the career resources we are developing should empower even more students to seek out
                PIT-themed work in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.</p>
