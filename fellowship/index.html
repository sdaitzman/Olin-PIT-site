            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>The PInT Summer 2021 Fellowship is a fully-funded program that will allow up to three of <a
                    href="http://www.olin.edu">Olin College’s</a> engineering students to work at public interest
                organizations and advance Olin’s <a
                    href="http://www.olin.edu/about/at-a-glance/vision-mission/">mission</a> to <em>recognize needs,
                    design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world</em>. We provide a
                stipend and a budget for travel, housing and supplies.</p>
            <p><a href="/">PInT</a> (as in “Public Interest Technology”) is a student-led effort to cultivate pathways
                and opportunities for Olin's students, faculty, and staff to be creators, engineers, designers, artists,
                and activists who leverage and deepen their powerful technical and creative skills for justice, equity,
                inclusion, and doing good in the world. As part of PInT’s greater effort to create strong career
                pathways for engineering students to make the world better, we hope this fellowship will expand
                awareness of public interest careers for engineers. PInT Fellows can choose to seek or create summer
                internships at public interest organizations such as government offices, public institutions,
                non-profits, community-based organizations, advocacy campaigns, foundations, environmental
                organizations, and more. <strong>We want you to find an organization that is doing things you are passionate
                about, where you can potentially affect positive change.</strong></p>

            <h1>WHAT’S IN IT FOR STUDENTS?</h1>
            <p>Summer breaks between semesters are the perfect opportunity for exploration, in addition to the
                traditional skill-building experience. This fellowship is a chance to swerve outside of obvious paths
                and have deep immersion into disciplinary expertise and professional practices in the emerging field of
                Public Interest Technology. You may operate in your host organization as someone with deep technical
                engineering know-how that benefits the group, if it’s desired, although that is not required to be part
                of the work you do.</p>
            <p>Through this fellowship, students already considering a future path in public interest technology have a
                chance to explore and navigate what that means. Students uncertain about their future path have an
                opportunity to explore what life and work are like for people working to serve the public interest. What
                are their goals and challenges? How did they construct their pathways? Where and when does engineering
                play a role in amplifying this work? You’ll be able to discover new professional routes for engineers
                and new uses for your engineering skills that you’d never imagined.</p>
            <p>To learn more about the transformative impact of this fellowship, connect with last year's fellows: Jocelyn Jimenez, Austin Veseliza, and Maia Materman. You can also read briefly about their work <a href="./past_fellows.html">here.</a></p>

            <h1>WHAT’S IN IT FOR PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS?</h1>
            <p>Are you interested in adding a summer intern from engineering fields to your team? We’re offering a
                fully-funded stipend for three students from Olin College of Engineering to be placed in public interest
                organizations such as government offices, public institutions, non-profits, community-based
                organizations, advocacy campaigns, foundations, environmental organizations, and more. These PInT
                Fellows can support your work in various roles: for technical work, non-technical work, or both,
                depending on the mutual interests and affinities between the individual and host. All Olin students do
                hands-on, team-based work in multiple engineering domains from their first days at Olin, and are
                selected for our community by demonstrating a collaborative, open-minded disposition in addition to
                their STEM training. We’re looking for organizations where any technical functions aren’t isolated in a
                silo. Instead, we want students to contextualize their work. Fellows will experience the broad
                connections between technology and society, and between different disciplines and organizational
                functions, from administration to direct service, activism, and all that is in between. Our fellows will
                be engineers-in-training who are explicitly passionate about connecting their work to your goals. If you
                have questions or would like to express interest, please reach out to us at <a
                    href="mailto:pintfellowship@olin.edu">pintfellowship@olin.edu</a>.</p>

            <p>The application form includes the following questions for response, in addition to a resume and two references. You will submit the application through this <a href="http://bit.ly/pintapp2021">Google Form</a>, but can use <a download aria-label="Download a PDF version of the application to save your answers while you work. Submit when ready." href="/fellowship/PInT_Fellowship_Application.pdf">this form-fillable PDF</a> to draft your responses.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After this fellowship, I will be the kind of _________ (person/engineer/public interest technologist/engaged citizen/artist/policymaker/your own word here/etc.) that…</li>
                <span class="subnote"><u>Please limit your response to 200 words.</u></span>
                <li>Considering your response above, and imagining the ideal type of work you want to do with this fellowship, list at least three organizations you are interested in.</li>
                <span class="subnote"><u>Please limit your total response to 500 words.</u> List each organization’s name, location, and website URL. Please describe the position you would assume or propose, and what work you would expect to do. Explain why you want to join each organization. You can share any specific goals, hopes, or hesitations, and you can respond briefly or in detail.
                </span>
                <li>Think back to when you wrote your Olin essay on change. Reflect on how your response today would compare to your response when you applied.</li>
                <span class="subnote"><u>Please limit your response to 300 words.</u> The most recent iteration of the Olin
                    application question reads: "Olin is a community striving to improve the world and improve people’s
                    lives through engineering education. What change do you hope to be a part of? Why is this particular
                    change important to you? How do you want to improve the world?" If you do not remember what you
                    wrote in response to this, think about how your pre-Olin self would have thought about this, and
                    compare it to how your current self feels.</span>
                <li>Working in a public interest technology role sometimes presents challenging questions and decisions with potential consequences for you, your partner organization, and/or the communities they serve. Tell us about a moment when you made a hard decision that could have significantly affected someone other than yourself. Your decision does not need to connect to public interest technology. </li>
                <span class="subnote"><u>Please limit your response to 300 words.</u> To help your reflection, think about the following questions, though you do not need to answer all of them:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Who was involved in the decision, and who could be affected by it?</li>
                        <li>How did your personal values and paradigms influence your decision-making process?</li>
                        <li>What was your deliberative process? Were there multiple decisions you made along the way? How did you reach the choice(s) you made?</li>
                        <li>Why was this choice a particularly tricky one? </li>
                        <li>If you were to encounter that choice or a similar one again, how would your decision-making process look different?</li>
                    </ol>

            <p>We explicitly invite people from underrepresented and marginalized groups to apply, and we are eager to work to

            <p>We seek to exceed legal requirements for accessibility and nondiscrimination. Your background should not
                affect your ability to apply for this fellowship, or succeed if accepted. Please reach out to <a

                requests.</p>

            <h1>WHY IS PInT DOING THIS?</h1>
            <p>Students can start to gain Public Interest Technology (PIT) work experience and insight into PIT careers
                through our pro-bono consulting projects and events. Summer fellowships support students to do work with
                organizations that would not normally hire engineering interns. Paying students to do extended projects
                that serve the public interest explicitly opens access to PIT careers to our students, especially if
                they cannot afford unpaid options.</p>
            <p>The fellowships will help students imagine themselves creating a PIT career and to credibly engage other
                students at Olin upon their return in seeing the wider universe of applications for their skills.
                Additionally, the career resources we are developing should empower even more students to seek out
                PIT-themed work in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors.</p>
